    "Throughout the semester, we will use the **Jupyter notebook** that provides an interactive environment for writing and running code (e.g. Python and R). Each notebook is associated with a single kernel. As we will be using Python, this notebook is associated with the IPython kernel. If you run your Python code, make sure that you have chosen the **\"Python 3\"** kernel on Jupyter notebook (see the upper-right corner of this notebook for this checking); and also, you need to add the code using **\"Code\"** cells, not **\"Markdown\"** cells. Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML.\n",

    "# Multi-processing functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-processsing is a core part of parallel programming. Given a job, in parallel programming, multiple processors are performed separately to complete the job. The job is split into the number of sub tasks and each processor is responsible for carrying out each sub task using a separate memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the following, we provide a brief overview of using the `Pool` approach that we will use throughout the semester for parallel data processing. The `Pool` class is used to represent a pool of worker processes. It has methods allowing us to offload a given job to the worker processes. \n",

    "There are two methods that are particularly interesting:\n",
