    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a leading NoSQL database, and stores Binary JSON documents (i.e. BSON) as data. MongoDB can mainpulate data flexibily allowing the documents to have different schemas. Thus, depending on needs of an application, the scheme can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is one of the most widely adopted big data databases. Unlike relational databases (RDBMS), MongoDB does not use pre-defined schema. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this activity, we will learn the following fundamentals in MongoDB:**\n",
    "- MongoDB data structure\n",
    "- How to use MongoDB shell and manage MongoDB documents. \n",
    "- How to create databases, as well as insert, update, and delete documents in MongoDB. \n",
    "- How to use different operators for retrieving documents in MongoDB with indexing.\n",

    "## 1. MongoDB Data Structure ##\n",
    "MongoDB uses data structured according to the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) standard. JSON is an open, human/machine readable standard for representing and exchanging data. As data types, it provides many different types such as numbers, string, boolean, and more complicated structure (e.g. arrays). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary JSON ###\n",
    "In the actual operation of MongoDB, it uses JSON documents in binary-encoded format (i.e. BSON). BSON extends the JSON model to provide additional data types such as a Date data type and BinData type (i.e. the base64 representation of a binary string).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at two examples of JSON documents below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Example**\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"sid\": 123,\n",
    "    \"name\": {\n",
    "    \"first\": \"Marie\",\n",
    "    \"last\": \"Currie\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "},\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's say the above example shows a simple student JSON document that has fields: `sid`, `name`, `first`, and `last`. Note that this document has an embeded document structure - the `name` field consists of two sub fields (`first` and `last`). These sub fields and their values can also be called \"embeded sub documents\". MongoDB documents make it possible to embed document structures in a field or array within a document. This actually shows that MongoDB has a flexible schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify or access a field of an embedded document, we can use **dot notation (.)**. We will learn more about this later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Example**\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "   \"unit_code\": \"FIT9132\",\n",
    "    \"unit_name\": \"Database\",\n",
    "    \"synopsis\":\"This unit will introduce the concept of data management in an organisation through relational database technology.\",\n",
    "    \"semester\": 1,\n",
    "    \"year\": [2017, 2018]\n",
    "}, \n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Imagine this example shows a simple unit document that has various fields: `unit_code`, `unit_name`, `synopsis`, `semester`, and `year`. Note that the field `year` (i.e. JSON array) can have multiple values, that is, an array of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identifier (_id) ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, documents are made up of field-value pairs. In particular, there is a special field \"_id\" that should be unique across all documents in the same collection in MongoDB. It holds the document identifier. If not explicitly specified by you, it will be automatically generated by MongoDB for each document. "

    "## 2. Running MongoDB ##\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB can run on most platforms (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac OSX). This section will help you understand the running configuration of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Open a terminal, run command 'mongod' to start the MongoDB database service (`mongod` is already running in VM).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mongod (primary daemon process)\n",
    "`mongod` is the primary daemon process or the core database service for the MongoDB system. It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs background management operations by communicating with MongoDB shell, `mongo`. Please note that `mongod` is already running in the VM provided to you as a startup service and the data files are stored in /var/lib/mongodb and  log files in /var/log/mongodb by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open another terminal, run command 'mongo' to start the mongo shell in the new terminal.\n",
    "#### mongo (MongoDB shell)\n",
    "Once `mongod` is running, we can use:\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "which is called MongoDB shell (simply mongo). This shell provides an interface for MongoDB where we can manipulate the data (load, read, search, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Open another terminal or a command prompt and type and run `mongo`. If no parameters are specified it connects to the default database named `test`. If you want to specify a database, you can enter: \n",
    "```\n",
    "mongo db_name\n",
    "``` \n",
    "If the database does not exist, it will be created automatically. Make sure that you need to run `mongod` first before you use `mongo`.\n",

    "db.FIT.find({\"unit_name\":\"Database\"}).explain(\"allPlansExecution\")\n",

    "In the output, can you find the value of the field: \"totalDocsExamined\"?. What about the value of the field: \"executionTimeMillis\"? In this output, the database scanned the entire collection which is inefficient. Can you improve its performance?\n",

    "Let’s create an index on the `sid` field using `createIndex()`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.indexTestCollection.createIndex({\"sid\":1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>\n",
    "**Practice**: Now run the same query for reading. Check the two fields: \"totalDocsExamined\" and \"executionTimeMillis\". What can you see now? Yes, there is no collection scan which is excellent. Now we see the value of using indexes.\n",
    "</font><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you have created an index on a field and some documents have the same value of the field. In this case, creating index on a field cannot ensure uniqueness. Thus, we need to put a constraint that uniqueness must be set to true when creating the index. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to create an index on the `first` field, and enable uniqueness to be true, then do the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "db.indexTestCollection.createIndex({\"first\": 1},{\"unique\":true})\n",
