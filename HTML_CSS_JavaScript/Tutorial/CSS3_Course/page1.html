                    <p> This is the second module in the FIT5147 Data Exploration and Visualisation unit. In this module you will learn about common graphics for showing tabular data. These are the kind of graphics that are common in statistics. </p>
                    <p> In this module we draw on material in the public domain, including journal articles and quite a few videos. We also have some interviews with data visualisation experts.</p>
                    <p> Another approach is to create a multi-dimensional graphic by essentially overlaying or juxtaposing the graphic elements from several two dimensional graphics to form a single chart. This is similar to small multiples but rather than creating a grid of charts, with one chart for each value of some selected variable, the salient graphic elements from these different charts are combined to form a single chart. </p>
