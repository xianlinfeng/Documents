1. invalid SCIP stage <10>
    a. when obj of s0 = 0. like total binary problem: "enigma.lp"
    b. most of time can be eliminated by deleting some constraints on p0

2. the instance "cast1.lp" 
    a. I use scip change the sense from max to min
    b. but with added y and constraints, the problem become unbounded.
